## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Build for desktop first


### What I learned

While tackling this exercise l learnt :
1. How to center images and text using ***text-align***. You can center images or text inside a block-level parent by setting the property text-align to center in the parent container. This centers the children.
2. How to center divs using ***Flexbox***. To achieve this you need to declare the property *display: flex* on the  parent container. Give the parent container a width and height and align-items and justify-content. 
3. How to deploy websites using Vercel.
4. How to write good commits.


### Continued development

Areas that l need to focus on more include: 
1. Deploying websites using Vercel and understanding the Vercel pipelines
2. Writing good commits, pull requests and using correct naming conventions for branches
3. Using git and GitHub
4. HTML and CSS
